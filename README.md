# ✨ Automate macOS Config with a BrewFile ✨
Easily install software and applications you use on your macOS by automating the process with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and a brewfile.

### Step 1:
Create your brewfile. 

A brewfile is a text file that lists the commands Homebrew needs to install specific software and applications. 
You can see mine here for inspiration: [my brewfile]()

### Step 2:
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by pasting this command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Step 3:
Run `brew bundle` in your terminal and watch the magic happen. If everything runs without error, you're in business 💃🏽
